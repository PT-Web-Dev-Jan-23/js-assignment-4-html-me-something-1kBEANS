         <h2>What Are Video Games?</h2>
         <p>
            The simple answer is that a video game is interactive digital entertainment that you “play” via a computer,
            a game console (like the Xbox or PlayStation) or a phone or tablet.
            There, you can go home now because class is over and we’re done.
            That really does sum it all up — but it’s not a very good explanation of everything going on here.

         <h2>Console Games</h2>
         <p>Console games are more commonly referred to as video games.
            They are played on a device specially made for game play called a video game console.
            The player interacts with the game through a controller, a hand-held device with buttons and joysticks or pads.

         <h2>Computer Games</h2>
         <p>
            A personal computer game, aka PC game, is a type of video game played on a personal computer (PC) rather than a console or phone.
            Its defining characteristics include: more diverse and user-determined gaming hardware and software; and generally greater capacity in input, processing, video and audio output.

         <h2>Mobile Games</h2>
         <p>Mobile games are games designed for mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablet PCs, etc.
            Mobile games range from basic (like Snake on older Nokia phones) to sophisticated (3D and augmented reality games).
            Today’s mobile phones - particularly smartphones - have a wide range of connectivity features, including infrared, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and 3G.
            These technologies facilitate wireless multiplayer games with two or more players.
